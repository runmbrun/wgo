General:
  - Make CSS changes to match site before Bootstrap 4 changes.
    - On Guild page - Page Size and Search are bolded and on top of combo box and textbox respectively (but not at MVCGrid.net?). (Need to update MVCGrid.Net DLL?)
  - Register/Login pages
    - Does this still work with all my changes? Connected to correct DB?
    - Is it needed?
    - Could create a special My Roster for each separate login.
  - Character View 
      - Show all the items, in table or grid format?
      - Show professions and talents.
  - Character Audit
      - Show all the Audit info: Missing Talents, No Spec, wrong armor type
  - Add item functionality: 
      - need new item table 
      - new field in the character table for the character item JSON data
  - JSONRaid Data - Get the current raid, and a list of bosses, and what the bosses drop. 
    - Show potential upgrades for entire raid
  
Guild Roster tab:
  - Put a guild check on a timer: 7am, 12pm, 7pm, 12am.
    - Not working perfectly: works for 1 time and then stops.
  
Raid Roster tab:
  - Raid Check
    - New button that will take user to a new page, that will do an audit for entire raid roster.
